Where do I even start.

How about a picture of her now.

The Beginning.

Back in 2015 * CHECK DATE * my friend and I purchased a 1976 * CHECK DATE * Ranger 28 sailboat. We went sailing almost every weekend with our friends and spend the entire day on the boat. We didn't take her out of the water until after Halloween we were having so much fun. During the winter Figment, our boats name, sat on our cradle waiting for the next sailing season. We on the other hand, the two of us both enjoying projects, decided what a great idea it would be to upgrade the inside of the boat by adding a ceiling and a floor. What a great idea we thought it would improve the look so well but what are we going to do about our leaky windows and deck, why don't we just replace them!

Moving to 2018 and enough work has been done to get her into the water. Now we just need to get the water pump fixed because the impeller died after sitting dry for 3ish years.
