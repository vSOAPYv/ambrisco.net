One of my passions is growing plants. I've grown up outside in vegetable and flower gardens mulching and pulling weeds, but unfortunately at my current place I don't have the ability to have an outside garden.  Now I am limited to just plants I can keep indoors, and the most rewarding one to me has become orchids!
